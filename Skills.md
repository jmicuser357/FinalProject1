# My skills
1. Hard work
2. Dependability
3. Creative Problem Solving
4. Responsibility

A lot of what I have to offer comes from my hobbies and what not. There is something being said about being boastfull about your own technical skills and so forth.
But I am still learning how to properly sell myself as it were. 

Also to be added
- Hand-eye coordination
- Resliliant
