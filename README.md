# Career Pursuits

>I have a lot to think about when it comes to my future, but I think I have a pretty good idea career wise what I want to do. With my bachelors in psychology, I would love to become a therapist/councelor and help others with finding meaning and purpose in life, as well as to help those struggling with inner demons and personal vices. Thats what I would love to do in the future.
