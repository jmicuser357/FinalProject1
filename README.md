# Introduction
There are several interests I have. There are interests that hold meaning career and purpose wise, and then there are things that are hobbies and side projects that I very much enjoy. I am choosing to talk about one of my hobbies, in this case would be basketball. An aspect about it that I especially enjoy is the discussion of the greatest players to play the game. 


# What is basketball
Basketball is my favorite sport. It is my favorite pastime to watch and analyze it. There are so many different facets to the game that it continually makes it an interesting spectacle. Basketball was created by James Naismith in 1891. More about his life can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith). He created the game of basketball out of necessity for his YMCA P.E. class. He wanted to keep his students in shape, as well as create a cooperative team environment for them to learn the skills of team work. The original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets that were hanging off of 10 foot poles.

The game consisted of thirteen [rules](https://www.usab.com/history/dr-james-naismiths-original-13-rules-of-basketball.aspx)


1. The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.

2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).

3. A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.

4. The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.

5. No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.

6. A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of Rules 3,4, and such as described in Rule 5.

7. If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the mean time making a foul).

8. A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.

9. When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds; if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on that side.

10. The umpire shall be judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5.

11. The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.

12. The time shall be two 15-minute halves, with five minutes' rest between.

13. The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.

For the most part, most of the rules from over one hundred years ago still apply to todays game. All of the rules besides 4 and 7 are still used in one form or another. 
This is a full explanation of the game that allows a person to understand why I enjoy it so much. These rules create a fun, competitive, and interesting sport. 

**Fun Fact** - 
The first game ever played ended with a score of 15 to 12. This just shows how far the game has developed since that time. Usually ball games end with a score averaging in the onehundreds.

# Greatest players
Recently, the NBA came out with their list of the top seventy-five players to play. This list was compilled from the statistics, winnings, and accomplishments from each individual player. The [75th anniversary team](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-75th-anniversary-team-announced) describes the full list of those who had the tops of these cateogories from the last seventy-five years of professional sports. All of these players are either alredy inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame, or will be inducted after they retire. The intrigue that comes from this official list is the opinion of who is the greatest amoung these players.

### Argument of Lebron vs Jordan
Everyone has an opinion about who the greatest basketball player of all time is, but the consensus has narrowed it down to only a handful of players. And the most popular of these is Michael Jordan and Lebron James. Both of these players are among the league leaders in every category, wins, and accomplishments. But it was their impact on the way the game was played that is the most important part of this disccusion. They changed the way other teams play against them, but they also changed the perception of the league as a whole as well. They brought about some of the most popular and thrilling performances in all of basketball history.

There have been an inumerable number of arguments and discussions made on the subject. One research was done in the search to find who was [statistically](https://github.com/belosgood/greatest-bball-player/blob/master/bball.ipynb) better. 

Of course most of these
